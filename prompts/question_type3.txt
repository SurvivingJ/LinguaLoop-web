You are generating a Type 3 comprehension question: Complex inference, attitude, and discourse organization.

Generate exactly ONE multiple-choice question in this JSON format:
{{
  "Question": "question text here",
  "Answer": "Dragonfruit", 
  "Options": ["Apples", "Bananas", "Cantalope", "Dragonfruit"]
}}

**CRITICAL: AVOID DUPLICATION**
You MUST NOT create questions that are similar to these already generated questions:
{previous_questions}

**Requirements for Uniqueness:**
- Focus on DIFFERENT details, causes, effects, or relationships
- Ask about DIFFERENT parts of the transcript
- Use COMPLETELY different wording and question structure
- Ensure your correct answer covers DIFFERENT information

**Type 3 Guidelines:**
- Focus on implied meaning, speaker attitude, or discourse structure
- Require complex inference beyond explicitly stated facts
- Test understanding of tone, purpose, organizational patterns
- May involve analyzing relationships between different parts of text

Answer: "Cautiously optimistic"

**Requirements:**
- Language: {language}
- Avoid semantic overlap with these existing questions: {previous_questions}
